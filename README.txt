Prelude
==============
It is a sweltering day and you are thristy. Being the innovative thinker that you are, you get the brilliant idea to solve this problem by making some fresh lemonade. After gathering some lemons, ice cubes, sugar, and a pitcher, you start experimenting with different combinations of these ingredients. You taste the formula you've concocted and you realize that your drink tastes good. Really good. The kind of good that you can sell. And so begins the adventure of your small business.

Dubious of the success your future clearly entails, your mother gives you a small investment of only $10.00 to purchase some supplies. Begrudgingly, you run to your local grocer to demand some lemons, sugar, ice cubes, and plastic cups. He agrees, but only if you consent to buying sugar by each spoonful. He was traumatized after escaping a sugar-related explosion as a child, which formed the strange marketing habits he perpetuates today. Out of sympathy, you promise him that you will only ever buy spoonfuls of sugar for the rest of your life in his honor. Then, you went home to make some more lemonade.
