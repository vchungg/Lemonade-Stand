Prelude
==============
It is a sweltering day and you are out of juice. Being the innovative thinker that you are, you get the brilliant idea to solve this problem by making some fresh lemonade. Gathering some lemons, ice cubes, sugar, and a pitcher, you begin to experiment with different combinations of these ingredients. Suddenly, you taste the formula you've concocted and you realize that the drink tastes good. Really good. The kind of good that you can sell. And so begins the adventure of your own small business.

Dubious of the success your future clearly entails, your mother gives you a small investment of $10.00 to purchase some stock. You run to your local grocer and demand some lemons, sugar, ice cubes, and plastic cups. He agrees, but only if you consent to buying sugar by each spoonful. He was traumatized after escaping a sugar-related explosion as a child, which formed his strange marketing habits he perpetuates today. Out of sympathy, you promise him that you will only ever buy spoonfuls of sugar for the rest of your life in his honor.
